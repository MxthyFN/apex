Unfortunetly, live at school today we lost 11 of our links. I am so extremely pissed about this, so we are retaliating.
If needed DDOS (shutting wifi off) is availible to us. I swear to god if these links get banned because our school can't
mind their buissness I will make them feel pain.

By the way pookies if these links get banned I am pressing the school about this. It is not okay that they  try to limit us.
#Let's Beat Them
[ADVERTISEMENT]": We have recently updated all of our links and changed a lot of the UI on our main site.
Go to ApexLink (File) and you can find the link.
Enjoy!
